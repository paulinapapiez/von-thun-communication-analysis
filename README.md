📣 Communication Analysis Using Von Thun’s Four-Sides Model

Authors: Paulina Papież, Julia Bugielska

🔹 Project Overview

This project analyzes professional communication using Friedemann Schulz von Thun’s Four-Sides Model (Four Ears).

We examine two real-life workplace messages to show how a single statement can be interpreted differently depending on which “side” or “ear” the recipient focuses on.

The analysis explores four key dimensions:

📝 Factual content – What is being said?

🤔 Self-revealing – What does the speaker reveal about themselves?

👥 Relationship – What does the statement indicate about the relationship?

📢 Appeal – What does the speaker want the recipient to do or feel?

💬 Messages Analyzed
1️⃣ Message 1

"I’m not sure if I can finish the presentation by tomorrow."
(Sender → Manager)

Key Insights:

Dimension	Insight
📝 Factual	Communicates the risk of not completing the task on time.
🤔 Self-revealing	Shows uncertainty and stress.
👥 Relationship	Respects hierarchy; careful tone.
📢 Appeal	Implicit request for support, guidance, or deadline extension.

Recipient Interpretation:
Can be seen as a simple update, a call for help, or (mis)interpreted as lack of commitment.

2️⃣ Message 2

"Great job, Ania – the slides look professional."
(Manager → Employee)

Key Insights:

Dimension	Insight
📝 Factual	Positive feedback on work quality.
🤔 Self-revealing	Expresses satisfaction and attention to quality.
👥 Relationship	Builds positive rapport and respect.
📢 Appeal	Encourages continuation of high-quality work.

Recipient Interpretation:
Recognized, motivated, and confident in future tasks.

📌 Summary

Even short messages can carry multiple layers of meaning. The Four-Sides Model helps to:

Understand why misunderstandings occur despite seemingly clear communication.

Recognize both the sender’s intent and the recipient’s interpretation.

Improve clarity and empathy in professional interactions.
