Communication Analysis Using Von Thun’s Four-Sides Model

Authors: Paulina Papież, Julia Bugielska

Project Overview

This project analyzes professional communication using the Four-Sides Model (Four Ears) by Friedemann Schulz von Thun. We examine two real-life workplace messages to explore how a single statement can be interpreted differently depending on which “side” or “ear” the recipient uses.

The analysis focuses on:

Factual content – What is being said?

Self-revealing – What does the speaker reveal about themselves?

Relationship – What does the statement indicate about the relationship?

Appeal – What does the speaker want the recipient to do or feel?

Messages Analyzed
Message 1

"I’m not sure if I can finish the presentation by tomorrow."
(Sender → Manager)

Key Insights:

Factual: Communicates the risk of not completing the task on time.

Self-revealing: Shows uncertainty and stress.

Relationship: Respects hierarchy; careful tone.

Appeal: Implicit request for support, guidance, or deadline extension.

Recipient Interpretation: Can be seen as a simple update, a call for help, or (mis)interpreted as lack of commitment.

Message 2

"Great job, Ania – the slides look professional."
(Manager → Employee)

Key Insights:

Factual: Positive feedback on work quality.

Self-revealing: Expresses satisfaction and attention to quality.

Relationship: Builds positive rapport and respect.

Appeal: Encourages continuation of high-quality work.

Recipient Interpretation: Recognized, motivated, and confident in future tasks.

Summary

Even short messages can carry multiple layers of meaning. The Four-Sides Model helps:

Understand why misunderstandings occur despite seemingly clear communication.

Recognize both the sender’s intent and the recipient’s interpretation.

Improve clarity and empathy in professional interactions.

Technologies / Tools

Analysis performed manually and documented in structured text.

Optional visualization or interactive dashboards can be added in R or Python if needed.

How to Use / Run

This is a descriptive/analytical project — no code execution is required.

For additional interactivity, consider converting this analysis into a Shiny app or Python dashboard to allow users to explore messages and interpretations dynamically.
